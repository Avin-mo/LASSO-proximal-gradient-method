<h1 id="l1-regularized-least-squares-lasso-via-proximal-gradient-ista">ℓ₁-Regularized Least Squares (LASSO) via Proximal Gradient (ISTA)</h1>
<p>This notebook presents a small project developed as part of my effort to learn about proximal methods and optimization algorithms.</p>
<p>While studying different regression problems and numerical solvers, I became interested in the following question:</p>
<p><strong>How does the structure of an objective function influence the optimization method used to solve it?</strong></p>
<p>Although this is a simple and well-studied question, the specific answer is not the primary focus of this project.<br />
Instead, the goal is to understand <em>where</em> these structural effects emerge within the algorithm and <em>how</em> they influence the algorithm’s behavior throughout the optimization process.</p>
<p>Rather than treating optimization methods as black boxes, this notebook connects the mathematical properties of the objective function with the observed computational behavior of the algorithm in practice.</p>
<p>The focus is ℓ₁-regularized linear regression, a problem whose non-smooth geometry fundamentally changes how optimization must be performed and provides a clear setting for studying these effects.</p>
<h2 id="why-l1-regularization">Why ℓ₁ Regularization?</h2>
<p>ℓ₁-regularized regression provides one of the simplest examples of an optimization problem where standard smooth methods are no longer directly applicable.</p>
<p>For comparison, consider the two common regularized least-squares formulations.</p>
<p>The ℓ₂-regularized (ridge) problem is:</p>
<p>$$
\min_x \; \frac12|Ax - b|_2^2 + \lambda |x|_2^2
$$</p>
<p>This objective is fully smooth and can be efficiently minimized using classical methods such as <strong>gradient descent</strong>, <strong>Newton’s method</strong>, or <strong>conjugate gradient methods</strong>, all of which rely on differentiability of the objective.</p>
<p>In contrast, the ℓ₁-regularized (LASSO) problem is:</p>
<p>$$
\min_x \; \frac12|Ax - b|_2^2 + \lambda |x|_1
$$</p>
<p>While the least-squares term remains smooth, the ℓ₁ regularization term introduces a non-smooth component. In particular, the ℓ₁ norm is <strong>non-differentiable at zero</strong>, which creates sharp kinks in the geometry of the objective.</p>
<p>Because of this non-smoothness, standard gradient-based methods are no longer well-defined at points where coefficients approach zero, and Newton-type methods that rely on second-order smoothness also break down.</p>
<p>I chose ℓ₁ regularization rather than ℓ₂ because it represents the simplest modification of a smooth regression problem that introduces a fundamental algorithmic complication. The presence of the non-differentiable ℓ₁ term changes not only the solution but also the class of optimization methods that can be applied.</p>
<p>Thus, ℓ₁-regularized regression provides a clean and controlled setting for studying how the structure of an objective function, specifically non-smoothness and sparsity, forces changes in optimization algorithm design.</p>
<h2 id="problem-formulation">Problem Formulation</h2>
<p>The problem studied in this project is ℓ₁-regularized least squares:</p>
<p>$$
\min_x \; \frac12|Ax - b|_2^2 + \lambda |x|_1
$$</p>
<p>where:</p>
<ul>
<li>$A \in \mathbb{R}^{m \times n}$ is the design matrix </li>
<li>$b \in \mathbb{R}^m$ is the observation vector </li>
<li>$x \in \mathbb{R}^n$ is the parameter vector </li>
<li>$\lambda &gt; 0$ controls the tradeoff between data fidelity and sparsity</li>
</ul>
<p>The objective consists of two components:</p>
<p>• a quadratic least-squares term that measures how well the model fits the data<br />
• an ℓ₁ penalty that encourages sparsity in the coefficients  </p>
<p>The regularization parameter $\lambda$ determines how strongly sparsity is enforced relative to data fidelity.</p>
<p>The least-squares term is smooth and has a Lipschitz-continuous gradient, so from an optimization perspective it behaves well. The ℓ₁ term, however, is fundamentally different: it penalizes all nonzero coefficients uniformly and is non-differentiable at zero.</p>
<p>The factor of one-half in the quadratic term is included for convenience, as it simplifies the gradient without affecting the solution.</p>
<p>Although the full objective is convex, so existence and uniqueness are not the primary concerns, the real challenge arises from combining a smooth term with a non-smooth one. This composite structure creates a geometry that standard gradient-based methods are not designed to handle.</p>
<p>As a result, the central question becomes not simply what the objective is, but how to optimize it in a way that respects this structure, using gradient information where it applies while explicitly handling the non-smooth behavior introduced by the ℓ₁ penalty.</p>
<h2 id="from-objective-structure-to-algorithmic-behavior-ista">From Objective Structure to Algorithmic Behavior: ISTA</h2>
<p>The composite structure of the ℓ₁-regularized objective fundamentally changes how the problem must be optimized. Standard gradient descent is no longer appropriate because near zero the objective is not smooth, and gradient information alone does not provide a meaningful descent direction.</p>
<p>This places the problem in the class of composite objectives, consisting of a smooth loss function combined with a non-smooth regularizer. For problems of this form, proximal gradient methods provide a natural optimization framework.</p>
<p>Rather than smoothing or approximating the ℓ₁ term, proximal gradient methods handle it directly by pairing a gradient step on the smooth component with a proximal step for the non-smooth component.</p>
<p>For ℓ₁-regularized least squares, this leads to the Iterative Soft-Thresholding Algorithm (ISTA), which performs the update:</p>
<p>$$
x^{k+1} = \mathrm{soft}\left(x^k - \alpha A^\top(Ax^k - b), \alpha \lambda\right)
$$</p>
<p>where the step size is chosen as:</p>
<p>$$
\alpha = \frac{1}{L}, \quad L = |A|_2^2
$$</p>
<p>For the ℓ₁ norm, the proximal operator has a closed-form solution given by soft-thresholding:</p>
<p>$$
\mathrm{soft}(z,\alpha\lambda)_i
= \mathrm{sign}(z_i)\max\left(|z_i| - \alpha\lambda,\, 0\right)
$$</p>
<p>This single update directly reflects the composite structure of the objective.</p>
<p>The gradient step reduces the data-fitting error, while the soft-thresholding step explicitly enforces sparsity by shrinking coefficients toward zero and setting small values exactly to zero.</p>
<p>I chose to implement ISTA directly, rather than relying on existing solvers, in order to observe how the mechanics of the algorithm reflect the geometry introduced by the ℓ₁ penalty.</p>
<p>What is most interesting is not simply the algorithm itself, but the behavior it produces. Sparsity is enforced at every iteration, and in practice the iterates tend to identify the active set early in the optimization process. After this point, convergence effectively occurs in a much lower-dimensional subspace.</p>
<p>This update rule drives all of the phenomena observed in the results that follow.</p>

<h1 id="implementations">Implementations</h1>
<p>I started by importing the libraries needed for this investigation:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
</code></pre>
<h2 id="synthetic-data-generation">Synthetic Data Generation</h2>
<p>To study the behavior of ISTA in a controlled setting, I construct a synthetic sparse regression problem with known ground truth.</p>
<p>The design matrix $$A \in \mathbb{R}^{m \times n}$$ is generated with independent Gaussian entries. A sparse true coefficient vector $x^*$ is then constructed by selecting $k$ random indices and assigning them nonzero values drawn from a Gaussian distribution, while all remaining entries are set to zero.</p>
<p>Observations are generated according to the linear model:</p>
<p>$$
b = Ax^* + \varepsilon
$$</p>
<p>where $\varepsilon$ is small Gaussian noise with standard deviation specified by <code>noise_std</code>.</p>
<p>This setup provides a simple yet diagnostic test problem. Because the true sparse solution is known, it allows direct examination of:</p>
<p>• how sparsity emerges during optimization<br />
• whether the correct support is identified<br />
• how recovery accuracy depends on the regularization parameter  </p>
<p>The goal is not realism, but clarity in observing the effects of ℓ₁ regularization and the behavior of the ISTA algorithm.</p>

</ul>
<h2 id="objective-gradient-prox-operator-and-step-size">Objective, Gradient, Prox Operator, and Step Size</h2>
<p>Before implementing ISTA, we define the core components required for each iteration of the proximal gradient method.</p>
<p>This includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>the <strong>LASSO objective function</strong>, which allows us to track convergence of the full composite objective  </li>
<li>the <strong>gradient of the smooth least-squares term</strong>, which determines the descent direction that reduces data-fitting error  </li>
<li>the <strong>soft-thresholding operator</strong>, which is the proximal operator associated with the ℓ₁ norm and explicitly handles the non-smooth regularization term  </li>
<li>the <strong>step size</strong> $\alpha = \frac{1}{L}$, chosen using the Lipschitz constant of the gradient of the smooth loss  </li>
</ul>
<p>The soft-thresholding operator arises from solving the proximal subproblem associated with the ℓ₁ penalty. At each iteration, instead of directly minimizing the full objective, proximal gradient methods minimize a local quadratic approximation of the smooth loss combined with the ℓ₁ regularizer. For the ℓ₁ norm, this minimization has a closed-form solution given by soft-thresholding.</p>
<p>Intuitively, soft-thresholding performs two actions simultaneously:</p>
<ul>
<li>it <strong>shrinks</strong> large coefficients toward zero  </li>
<li>it <strong>eliminates</strong> small coefficients entirely by setting them exactly to zero  </li>
</ul>
<p>This is the mechanism through which sparsity is enforced during optimization.</p>
<p>The step size $\alpha$ is determined by the Lipschitz constant $L$ of the gradient of the smooth term $f(x)=\tfrac12|Ax-b|_2^2$.<br />
For least squares, this constant is:</p>
<p>$$
L = |A|_2^2
$$</p>
<p>where $|A|_2$ denotes the spectral norm (largest singular value) of $A$.</p>
<p>This quantity measures how rapidly the gradient of the loss can change. Choosing $\alpha = \frac{1}{L}$ ensures that each proximal gradient step is stable and that the composite objective decreases monotonically under standard theoretical conditions.</p>
<p>Together, these components translate the mathematical structure of the objective directly into the mechanics of the ISTA update used in the following section.</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">def lasso_objective(A, b, x, lam):
    r = A @ x - b

<p>This section runs ISTA on a single synthetic LASSO instance and then visualizes the optimization dynamics.</p>
<p>The workflow is:</p>
<ol>
<li>Generate a controlled synthetic problem $(A, b, x^*)$ with known sparse ground truth.  </li>
<li>Choose a representative regularization value $\lambda = 0.05$ and run ISTA to obtain an estimate $\hat{x}$.  </li>
<li>Print summary diagnostics, including sparsity of $\hat{x}$, the final objective value, and recovery error $|\hat{x} - x^*|_2$.  </li>
<li>Plot three diagnostics for a single run:</li>
<li>objective value vs iteration  </li>
<li>number of nonzeros vs iteration  </li>
<li>true vs recovered coefficients  </li>
<li>Perform a sweep over $\lambda$ to study how the regularization parameter controls:</li>
<li>final sparsity  </li>
<li>recovery error  </li>
</ol>
<p>These plots are intended to highlight the qualitative behavior discussed earlier, particularly active-set identification and the bias–sparsity tradeoff.</p>

<h1 id="graph-analysis">Graph Analysis</h1>
<p>Below I will go over what each of the graphs implemented represent as a result of this investigation.</p>
<h3 id="objective-vs-iterartion">Objective vs. Iterartion</h3>
<p><img src="figures/objective_vs_iterations.png" width="500"></p>
<p>I began with a representative value of $\lambda = 0.05$ to establish a baseline for how the algorithm behaves on this problem.</p>
<p>This plot first serves as a sanity check. With a Lipschitz-continuous gradient and the chosen step size, proximal gradient theory predicts monotone decrease of the composite objective, which is exactly what is observed.</p>
<p>More interesting is the overall shape of the curve. The objective decreases rapidly during the early iterations, followed by a much slower phase of refinement. This reflects a two-stage behavior: initially, the algorithm corrects large data-fitting errors while the proximal step aggressively eliminates irrelevant coefficients. Later, once the active set begins to stabilize, the optimization effectively proceeds in a lower-dimensional subspace and progress becomes incremental.</p>
<p>This highlights that most meaningful structural progress occurs well before full convergence. The plot therefore motivates examining sparsity evolution alongside objective values, where the geometric effects of the ℓ₁ penalty become explicit.</p>
<h3 id="sparsity-over-iteration">Sparsity over Iteration</h3>
<p><img src="figures/sparsity-over-iterations.png" width="500"></p>
<p>This plot illustrates how the number of nonzero coefficients evolves over iterations, making the effect of the ℓ₁ proximal step explicit.</p>
<p>Starting from the initial iterate, sparsity increases steadily as the soft-thresholding operator drives more coefficients exactly to zero.</p>
<p>What is particularly informative is the manner in which this occurs. Rather than collapsing immediately to a fixed support, sparsity is enforced gradually across iterations. This indicates that the algorithm continuously re-evaluates which coefficients remain active as the balance between data fit and regularization evolves.</p>
<p>This highlights that sparsity is not a one-time decision or a post-processing effect. Instead, support identification is intertwined with convergence itself, and the ℓ₁ penalty actively reshapes the solution throughout the optimization process.</p>
<h3 id="true-vs-recovered-coefficients">True vs. Recovered Coefficients</h3>
<p><img src="figures/true-vs-recovered-coefficients.png" width="500"></p>
<p>In this plot, the blue stems represent the true coefficient vector $x^*$, which is sparse with a small number of nonzero entries, while the orange markers represent the coefficients recovered by ISTA.</p>
<p>Most coordinates are driven close to zero, while a small subset remains active. For these active coordinates, the recovered coefficients largely align with the true nonzero locations, indicating effective support identification. However, their magnitudes are systematically smaller than those of the true coefficients.</p>
<p>This behavior highlights two fundamental effects of ℓ₁ regularization. First, the algorithm successfully recovers the support of the sparse solution, as the nonzero entries of the estimate largely coincide with those of the ground truth. Second, even when the support is correctly identified, the ℓ₁ penalty induces uniform shrinkage of coefficient magnitudes.</p>
<p>This confirms that ISTA is not merely enforcing sparsity, but is solving the intended ℓ₁-regularized optimization problem.</p>
<p>The plot also illustrates the bias–sparsity tradeoff inherent in ℓ₁ regularization. While ℓ₁ penalties are highly effective for variable selection, they systematically shrink coefficients, leading to biased estimates. From an optimization perspective, this reflects the action of the proximal step; from a statistical perspective, it explains why ℓ₁ regularization is often better suited for support identification than for unbiased coefficient estimation. This naturally motivates post-selection refitting or the use of alternative regularizers when coefficient accuracy is important.</p>
<h3 id="sparsity-vs-lambda">Sparsity vs. $\lambda$</h3>
<p><img src="figures/sparsity-vs-lambda.png" width="500"></p>
<p>This plot shows how the final number of nonzero coefficients varies with the regularization parameter $\lambda$.</p>
<p>As $\lambda$ increases, the solution becomes progressively sparser. Small values of $\lambda$ produce relatively dense solutions, while larger values lead to a monotonic reduction in the number of active coefficients.</p>
<p>This behavior reflects the role of $\lambda$ in controlling the strength of the ℓ₁ penalty and, consequently, the geometry of the optimization problem. As $\lambda$ increases, the ℓ₁ term becomes more dominant, pushing the solution toward the coordinate axes and eliminating more coefficients.</p>
<p>This confirms that sparsity is not an incidental outcome of optimization, but a predictable and tunable consequence of the regularization parameter. Since sparsity is often the primary motivation for ℓ₁ regularization in applications such as feature selection and dimensionality reduction, understanding this relationship is essential for controlling model complexity in practice.</p>
<h3 id="recovery-error-vs-lambda">Recovery Error vs. $\lambda$</h3>
<p><img src="figures/recovery-error-vs-lambda.png" width="500"></p>
<p>This plot shows how the recovery error $|\hat{x} - x^*|_2$ varies with the regularization parameter $\lambda$.</p>
<p>Over the range considered, the recovery error decreases as $\lambda$ increases. Smaller values of $\lambda$ produce larger errors, while stronger regularization leads to more accurate recovery of the true sparse coefficient vector in this experiment.</p>
<p>This behavior reflects the stabilizing effect of regularization. When $\lambda$ is too small, the optimizer prioritizes data fit and produces dense solutions that overfit noise in the observations. Increasing $\lambda$ suppresses noise sensitivity and improves sparse signal recovery.</p>
<p>At the same time, excessively large values of $\lambda$ would introduce strong shrinkage bias by overly penalizing nonzero coefficients. This illustrates the bias–variance tradeoff inherent in ℓ₁-regularized estimation, with optimal performance typically occurring at intermediate values of $\lambda$ rather than at the extremes.</p>
<h3 id="choice-of-regularization-parameter">Choice of Regularization Parameter</h3>
<p>Based on these trends, I selected $\lambda = 0.05$ as a representative value for the baseline experiments.</p>
<p>Smaller values of $\lambda$ produce dense solutions where the geometric effects of the ℓ₁ penalty are less visible and noise dominates the solution. Larger values overemphasize sparsity and introduce strong shrinkage bias.</p>
<p>The choice $\lambda = 0.05$ lies in an intermediate regime where sparsity, support recovery, and the bias–variance tradeoff are all clearly observable. The goal was not to optimize numerical performance, but to select a value that makes the algorithm’s structural behavior most diagnostic.</p>
<hr />
<h1 id="conclusion-and-key-takeaways">Conclusion and Key Takeaways</h1>
<p>This project highlighted that performance in ℓ₁-regularized optimization is governed less by asymptotic convergence rates and more by how quickly algorithmic structure is identified.</p>
<p>Across the experiments, the behavior of ISTA was dominated by early active-set identification. Most of the meaningful structural decisions occurred during the initial iterations, when the algorithm determined which coefficients should be driven to zero. Once the active set stabilized, the optimization effectively proceeded in a much lower-dimensional subspace, and subsequent iterations primarily refined coefficient values.</p>
<p>This observation reframed how ℓ₁ regularization is viewed in practice. Rather than acting solely as a penalty that produces sparse solutions at convergence, the ℓ₁ term actively shapes the entire optimization trajectory. The geometry introduced by the non-smooth regularizer influences both the path taken by the algorithm and the evolution of the solution structure over time.</p>
<p>More broadly, the project demonstrated that worst-case convergence guarantees alone do not fully describe practical algorithm behavior. To understand how composite optimization methods perform in structured, high-dimensional problems, it is essential to examine when structural features such as sparsity are identified and how the algorithm behaves before and after this transition.</p>
<p>This perspective motivates further study of more advanced proximal and composite optimization methods, such as accelerated or variance-reduced schemes, with particular attention to their impact on active-set identification and structural dynamics.</p>
<p>Overall, this project reinforced the importance of analyzing optimization algorithms not only in terms of objective decrease, but also in terms of how they discover and exploit structure in the underlying problem.</p></div>
