While \u2113\u2081 penalties are highly effective for variable selection, they systematically shrink coefficients, leading to biased estimates. From an optimization perspective, this reflects the action of the proximal step; from a statistical perspective, it explains why \u2113\u2081 regularization is often better suited for support identification than for unbiased coefficient estimation. This naturally motivates post-selection refitting or the use of alternative regularizers when coefficient accuracy is important.</p>"},{"location":"LASSO/#sparsity-vs-lambda","title":"Sparsity vs. $\\lambda$","text":"<p>This plot shows how the final number of nonzero coefficients varies with the regularization parameter $\\lambda$.</p> <p>As $\\lambda$ increases, the solution becomes progressively sparser.

Most of the meaningful structural decisions occurred during the initial iterations, when the algorithm determined which coefficients should be driven to zero. Once the active set stabilized, the optimization effectively proceeded in a much lower-dimensional subspace, and subsequent iterations primarily refined coefficient values.</p> <p>This observation reframed how \u2113\u2081 regularization is viewed in practice. Rather than acting solely as a penalty that produces sparse solutions at convergence, the \u2113\u2081 term actively shapes the entire optimization trajectory. The geometry introduced by the non-smooth regularizer influences both the path taken by the algorithm and the evolution of the solution structure over time.</p> <p>More broadly, the project demonstrated that worst-case convergence guarantees alone do not fully describe practical algorithm behavior. To understand how composite optimization methods perform in structured, high-dimensional problems, it is essential to examine when structural features such as sparsity are identified and how the algorithm behaves before and after this transition.</p> <p>This perspective motivates further study of more advanced proximal and composite optimization methods, such as accelerated or variance-reduced schemes, with particular attention to their impact on active-set identification and structural dynamics.</p> <p>Overall, this project reinforced the importance of analyzing optimization algorithms not only in terms of objective decrease, but also in terms of how they discover and exploit structure in the underlying problem.</p>"}]}
