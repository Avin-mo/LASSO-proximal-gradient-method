    "\n",

    "\n",
    "Rather than treating optimization methods as black boxes, this notebook connects the mathematical properties of the objective function with the observed computational behavior of the algorithm in practice.\n",

    "## Why ℓ₁ Regularization?\n",
    "\n",
    "ℓ₁-regularized regression provides one of the simplest examples of an optimization problem where standard smooth methods are no longer directly applicable.\n",
    "\n",
    "For comparison, consider the two common regularized least-squares formulations.\n",
    "\n",
    "The ℓ₂-regularized (ridge) problem is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\min_x \\; \\frac12\\|Ax - b\\|_2^2 + \\lambda \\|x\\|_2^2\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This objective is fully smooth and can be efficiently minimized using classical methods such as **gradient descent**, **Newton’s method**, or **conjugate gradient methods**, all of which rely on differentiability of the objective.\n",
    "\n",
    "In contrast, the ℓ₁-regularized (LASSO) problem is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\min_x \\; \\frac12\\|Ax - b\\|_2^2 + \\lambda \\|x\\|_1\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "While the least-squares term remains smooth, the ℓ₁ regularization term introduces a non-smooth component. In particular, the ℓ₁ norm is **non-differentiable at zero**, which creates sharp kinks in the geometry of the objective.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because of this non-smoothness, standard gradient-based methods are no longer well-defined at points where coefficients approach zero, and Newton-type methods that rely on second-order smoothness also break down.\n",
    "\n",
    "I chose ℓ₁ regularization rather than ℓ₂ because it represents the simplest modification of a smooth regression problem that introduces a fundamental algorithmic complication. The presence of the non-differentiable ℓ₁ term changes not only the solution but also the class of optimization methods that can be applied.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, ℓ₁-regularized regression provides a clean and controlled setting for studying how the structure of an objective function, specifically non-smoothness and sparsity, forces changes in optimization algorithm design.\n"

    "\n",
    "• a quadratic least-squares term that measures how well the model fits the data  \n",
    "• an ℓ₁ penalty that encourages sparsity in the coefficients  \n",
    "\n",
    "The regularization parameter $\\lambda$ determines how strongly sparsity is enforced relative to data fidelity.\n",
    "\n",
    "The least-squares term is smooth and has a Lipschitz-continuous gradient, so from an optimization perspective it behaves well. The ℓ₁ term, however, is fundamentally different: it penalizes all nonzero coefficients uniformly and is non-differentiable at zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "The factor of one-half in the quadratic term is included for convenience, as it simplifies the gradient without affecting the solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although the full objective is convex, so existence and uniqueness are not the primary concerns, the real challenge arises from combining a smooth term with a non-smooth one. This composite structure creates a geometry that standard gradient-based methods are not designed to handle.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a result, the central question becomes not simply what the objective is, but how to optimize it in a way that respects this structure, using gradient information where it applies while explicitly handling the non-smooth behavior introduced by the ℓ₁ penalty.\n"

This reflects a two-stage behavior: initially, the algorithm corrects large data-fitting errors while the proximal step aggressively eliminates irrelevant coefficients. Later, once the active set begins to stabilize, the optimization effectively proceeds in a lower-dimensional subspace and progress becomes incremental.\n",

This indicates that the algorithm continuously re-evaluates which coefficients remain active as the balance between data fit and regularization evolves.\n",

For these active coordinates, the recovered coefficients largely align with the true nonzero locations, indicating effective support identification. However, their magnitudes are systematically smaller than those of the true coefficients.\n",
    "\n",
    "This behavior highlights two fundamental effects of ℓ₁ regularization. First, the algorithm successfully recovers the support of the sparse solution, as the nonzero entries of the estimate largely coincide with those of the ground truth. Second, even when the support is correctly identified, the ℓ₁ penalty induces uniform shrinkage of coefficient magnitudes.\n",

    "This confirms that ISTA is not merely enforcing sparsity, but is solving the intended ℓ₁-regularized optimization problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "The plot also illustrates the bias–sparsity tradeoff inherent in ℓ₁ regularization. While ℓ₁ penalties are highly effective for variable selection, they systematically shrink coefficients, leading to biased estimates. From an optimization perspective, this reflects the action of the proximal step; from a statistical perspective, it explains why ℓ₁ regularization is often better suited for support identification than for unbiased coefficient estimation. This naturally motivates post-selection refitting or the use of alternative regularizers when coefficient accuracy is important.\n"

    "# Conclusion and Key Takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "This project highlighted that performance in ℓ₁-regularized optimization is governed less by asymptotic convergence rates and more by how quickly algorithmic structure is identified.\n",
    "\n",
    "Across the experiments, the behavior of ISTA was dominated by early active-set identification. Most of the meaningful structural decisions occurred during the initial iterations, when the algorithm determined which coefficients should be driven to zero. Once the active set stabilized, the optimization effectively proceeded in a much lower-dimensional subspace, and subsequent iterations primarily refined coefficient values.\n",
    "\n",
    "This observation reframed how ℓ₁ regularization is viewed in practice. Rather than acting solely as a penalty that produces sparse solutions at convergence, the ℓ₁ term actively shapes the entire optimization trajectory. The geometry introduced by the non-smooth regularizer influences both the path taken by the algorithm and the evolution of the solution structure over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "More broadly, the project demonstrated that worst-case convergence guarantees alone do not fully describe practical algorithm behavior. To understand how composite optimization methods perform in structured, high-dimensional problems, it is essential to examine when structural features such as sparsity are identified and how the algorithm behaves before and after this transition.\n",
    "\n",
    "This perspective motivates further study of more advanced proximal and composite optimization methods, such as accelerated or variance-reduced schemes, with particular attention to their impact on active-set identification and structural dynamics.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, this project reinforced the importance of analyzing optimization algorithms not only in terms of objective decrease, but also in terms of how they discover and exploit structure in the underlying problem.\n"
